## Repository guide
Within this repository you will find the code materials used during the Mixtures Workshop 2022. To help you navigate the repository, below is a description of the repository organization.

The repository is organized into two main folders "Unsupervised" and "Supervised" which contained the materials for the unsupervised and supervised methods correspondingly. 

### Unsupervised

The Unsupervised folder is subdivided into three folders: 

[Clustering](Unsupervised/Clustering)

[Factor Analysis (FA)](Unsupervised/FA) 

[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](Unsupervised/PCA)


### Supervised

The supervised folder is subdivided into four folders: 

[Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR)](Supervised/BKMR)

[Tree Based Methods](Supervised/Tree%20Based%20Methods)

[Variable Selection](Supervised/Variable%Selection)

[WQS](Supervised/WQS)

All the materials for each respective method are within its folder. Note: the RMD file titled with the method's name contains the main code.  

### Additional folders

In addition to the Unsupervised and Supervised folders you will find the following folders: 

[Data](Data) contains the data and the data dictionary

[Mitro_et_al_materials](Mitro_et_al_materials) contains the paper by Mitro et al.
